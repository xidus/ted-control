# TED control-script

A module to interface with the tools provided by my codebase for my master's thesis project.

# About

This module was made as part of my master's thesis project.

It calls functions within a Python package that I call [Transient-Event Detector (TED)](https://github.com/xidus/ted).

# Running the code

The module is meant to be called directly from the command line.

(Examples might show up here. Otherwise, look through the code and see what it does.)
