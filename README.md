# TED control-script

A module to interface with the tools provided by my codebase for my master's thesis project.

# About

This module was made as part of my master's thesis project.

It calls functions within a Python package that I call [Transient-Event Detector (TED)](https://github.com/xidus/ted).

# Requirements

The script runs in Python 2.7.6+, but not in Python 3+.

It depends on a argument-parsing module that I have written, called [`setup_and_parse`](https://github.com/xidus/setup_and_parse).

# Running the code

The module is meant to be called directly from the command line.

(Examples might show up here. Otherwise, look through the code and see what it does.)
